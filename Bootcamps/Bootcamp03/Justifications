Advantages & Disadvantages of using Int vs java string for BuyerID
    Advantages of Integers
    - Integers are simpler than strings
    - Uses less space compared to Strings
    - Faster to compare Integers


    Disadvantages
    - There are possible combinations of integers, as there are only 10 unique single digit integers
    - Can have shorter alphanumeric ID's that have the same total number of possible combinations compared to an int ID

    My Choice
    - I chose to use integers as the ID because
        *We won't have many buyer entries so combinations are not of concern
        *It's simpler to use
        *ID's will be Quick to validate/compare against each other

Given & Family Name vs First & Last Name
    - Using First & Last name would pass over those which have given names of more than 1 word
        eg. Anthony John Smith would only appear as Anthony Smith
    - Family name is the name which is shared with their family but is not necessarily the Last name
